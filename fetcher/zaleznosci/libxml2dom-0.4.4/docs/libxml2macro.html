<h1>libxml2macro</h1>
<p>The libxml2macro tool and accompanying libraries (<code>libxml2dom.macrolib</code>)
provide and experimental mechanism for writing normal DOM-style code
(with node objects) and being able to transform such code into direct
calls and accesses to the low-level libxml2mod API. Since libxml2dom
now makes use of these libraries, and since the objects created at the
libxml2dom level do not necessarily introduce a huge time or memory
overhead, this mechanism is now more an experimental curiosity than
anything of practical use. Moreover, the generated code does not
attempt to clean up after libxml2, potentially introducing memory leaks
into programs.</p>
<h2>Using libxml2macro</h2>
<p>The libxml2macro approach is as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Write code using the PyXML-inspired DOM-style API, but giving
node variables and attributes a distinct prefix.</li>
  <li>Run the supplied tool <code>libxml2macro.py</code> on the source
file.</li>
  <li>Invoke the compiled module directly or import it into programs as
usual.</li>
</ul>
<p>A description of the process is given in the <code>README.txt</code>
file
within the source code distribution. However, what libxml2macro does is
to
take code like this...</p>
<pre>for my_node in my_element.childNodes:<br>    if my_node.nodeType == TEXT_NODE:<br>        print my_node.nodeValue</pre>
<p>...and to transform it into something more or less like this
(although in
practice the actual libxml2mod calls are provided in a library,
although more
aggressive transformations could result in something actually like
this):</p>
<pre>for my_node in libxml2mod.children(my_element):<br>    if libxml2mod.type(my_node) == "text":<br>        print libxml2mod.xmlNodeGetContent(my_node)</pre>
<p>The result is that developers can still write DOM-style code but not
be
penalised for the object-related overhead that such an approach
typically
incurs.</p>
